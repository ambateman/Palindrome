# Palindrome
My palindrome solution based on interview questions
The question of testing to see if a string is a palindrome comes up often in technical interviews. This is reasonable given time constraints and the straight forward way it can be tested.
I often forget steps when I am at a whiteboard, so this is my exercise in making sure I get it right next time. 
I could have set up a while loop to keep asking for strings, but this gets the point across.
